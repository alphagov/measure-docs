# Doc-a-thon

A collaborative technical content review

Why?

Reinforces principle that an entire team owns the technical documentation and are all responsible for it

How?

Product team split into pairs/threes

Each group reviews one section of tech docs

All feedback is welcome!

Categorise feedback

Glad - things that are clear, accurate and need to stay (green)

Sad - things that are misleading, inaccurate and need to change (pink)

Nice to have - things that should be considered in future iterations (yellow)

Print out the content

Set up a jamboard for feedback so it goes straight on to the cloud - saves time in writeup

Write up feedback

Prioritise work with team management and write stories

Improve the docs!

It’s a great way to engage your team to read the tech docs

If you have a multidisciplinary team, make sure each pair or group contains a mix of tech and non-tech people. Emphasise to the non-tech people that their input is valuable as they understand the product. Especially in terms of asking “silly” questions.

Split content by size (SML). Start with small to get participants warmed up

Be flexible and give people more time if they need it

Ask participants to put their names on what they’ve worked on. This is useful when it comes to doing the follow-up work
