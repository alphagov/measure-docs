# Doc-a-thon

A doc-a-thon is collaborative technical content review with the team whose content it is.

A doc-a-thon reinforces to service teams that we are all responsible for technical content, rather than just the technical writer.

## Prepare the doc-a-thon

Decide which content to include in the session. You can do this by:

- identifying content that has not been updated in a long time or is not in style
- looking at google analytics to see which parts of your technical content are the most popular
- seeing which content aligns to the team missions or epics

Speak to the team management, for example the tech lead, product manager, and delivery manager. Explain what you're doing and why, and get their support and buy-in.

Schedule the doc-a-thon so the maximum number of team members can attend. Book a room if possible.

Set up a [Google Jamboard](https://jamboard.google.com/) to record the feedback. This saves time in writing up the feedback. Refer to the [example Jamboard]() for a template to use.

Print out the content to give to team members in the doc-a-thon.

## Run the doc-a-thon

Split the team into pairs or groups of 3 people.

Split the content into small, medium and large. Start with small to get team members warmed up, and then move on to mdeium and finally large pieces of content.

If you have a multidisciplinary team, make sure each pair or group contains a mix of technical and non-technical people. Emphasise to the non-technical people that their input is valuable as they understand the product, and do not be afraid to ask “silly” questions.

Give each group one piece of content to review and set a 20 minute time limit.

Each group must categorise their feedback into:

- glad - things that are clear, accurate and need to stay (green sticky note)
- sad - things that are misleading, inaccurate and need to change (pink)
- nice to have - things that should be considered in future iterations (yellow)

Be flexible and give groups more time if they need.

Ask participants to put their names on what they’ve worked on. This is useful when it comes to doing follow-up work.

## After the doc-a-thon

Analyse the feedback, prioritise work with team management and write up any required stories.

Present back to the tech writing and content communities on your process, results and lessons learned.
