# Task-based user research

A detailed user research exercise that tests if users can accomplish a task or tasks.

This allows you to test if the documentation is fulfilling the user need.

You should schedule a dedicated session to do this exercise.

## Prepare the session

Follow user research best practice and work with a user researcher if possible. See the [GDS Wiki on user research](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/communities-of-practice/user-research) for more information.

Write a discussion guide for the user research session. See the GOV.UK Notify API client documentation discussion guide example.

Recruit multiple users for the exercise. Try to ensure they are as varied as possible in their skills, whilst having the experience needed to make the session useful.

## Run the session

Record the session so you can playback the answers.

Make sure research participants sign a consent form.

Listen to the session and make notes. Have another note-taker so you can compare your information.

## After the session

Analyse the feedback and iterate the content.

Present back to the tech writing and content communities on your process, results and lessons learned.
