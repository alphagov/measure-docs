## Useful Analytics

### User

An individual person browsing your website. Each unique browser cookie will be counted as a separate user. This means that someone visiting your website on multiple devices (each with their own browser cookie) will mean more than one user is reported.

### New user

People that visit your website for the first time in the selected date range. Since users are based on the Google Analytics tracking code and browser cookies, it’s important to highlight that people who cleared their cookies or access your website using a different device will be reported as a new user.

### Pageview

A pageview is recorded every time a page is viewed. This includes:

- when a user hits the back button
- when a visitor hits refresh
- every time a page is opened in the browser

### Unique pageview

A unique pageview counts a page once even if that page was viewed multiple times within a single session.

### Bounce Rate

A “bounce” occurs when someone visits your website and leaves without interacting further with your site. Bounce rate is the percentage of sessions with a single pageview.

## Caveats

Google Analytics do not measure content quality i.e. they do not say if users find the content useful or if it fulfilled their user needs.

Google Analytics are simple measures of output quantity. However they lack context on why these numbers and trends are occurring.

This is especially true when analysing bounce rate. Generally, low bounce rates are viewed as good as this shows users interacting with your website. However, a high bounce rate on content pages is not necessarily bad as users could have obtained the information they came for and did not need to go any further beyond the page.

Check if your Google Analytics includes the correct users.
